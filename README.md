A layout experiment / design treatment of the Philippine Constitution in a website.

I've been looking around how websites presented the document and my short attention span can't cope. It's either the whole document presented as a long single page or divided into multiple webpages. So I made my own single page layout that presents the whole document but divides it into parts with a table of contents for easy navigation.

# Features:
- Mobile and desktop friendly / Responsive layout
- Per section collapsible view
- Table of contents / Article buttons
