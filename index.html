Within forty-eight hours from the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, the President shall submit a report in person or in writing to the Congress. The Congress, voting jointly, by a vote of at least a majority of all its Members in regular or special session, may revoke such proclamation or suspension, which revocation shall not be set aside by the President.
